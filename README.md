# Todo APplication for Altschool second semester's exams

The application was built using create react and vanilla CSS.

It implements the CRUD functionality,
- Create
- Update
- Delete

The application can locally create a new todo which will be added to the list, and this is made possible using local storage.

An existing todo can be updated/edited, wether it is the locally created todo or the todos fetched from the API.

A todo can also be deleted from the list using the delete functionality.

I also implemented a search and filter functionality to the application.

There is also a toggle functionality, where todos can be toggled to either completed or still be in progress.

I did not follow an existing UI design, therefore the design of this application is from my imagination and design.

## Deployment of Application

The application was deployed and hosted live using Vercel, [link to live application] (https://todo-app-ten-alpha-63.vercel.app/).
